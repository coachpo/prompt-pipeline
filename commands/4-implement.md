## Shared Payload Contract
- File: `handoff/payload.json`
- Required fields before starting: `requirement.summary`, `plan.steps`, `testPlan.scenarios`.
- Must update:
  - `meta.currentStage = "4-implement"`, `meta.lastUpdatedBy`, `meta.lastUpdatedAt`.
  - `implementation.changes` (file-level notes, diffs, rationale), `implementation.tests` (added/updated suites), `implementation.commands` (commands run + outcomes).
  - May append clarifications to `plan.steps[*].status` and `testPlan.scenarios[*].status` but must not delete prior data.

## User Input — contains the full brief

# Implementation Workflow

## 0. Intake & Focus
- Parse the input for task order, target files, success metrics, and validation expectations; capture unknowns as follow-up questions.
- Confirm tooling (language versions, build scripts, linters) described in the brief so environment surprises do not derail execution.

## 1. Environment Recon
- Inspect the referenced packages using **Desktop Commander** (`list_directory`, `read_file`, `start_search`) to understand current implementations.
- For semantic insight into functions and call chains, use **Serena** (`get_symbols_overview`, `find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`).
- Note baseline behavior, TODOs, or guardrails from the code so changes stay context-aware.

## 2. Stepwise Execution
- Follow the ordered tasks from the brief; keep each code change tightly scoped and commit-ready.
- Before writing a function, outline its signature, invariants, and links to acceptance criteria/tests stated in the input.
- Use **Serena** editing APIs (`insert_before_symbol`, `replace_symbol_body`, `write_file`) for symbol-aware modifications; fall back to **Desktop Commander** (`write_file`, `edit_block`) for file-level edits.
- Maintain a lightweight progress log so other contributors can see which tasks are complete (update `plan.steps[*].status`).

## 3. Pattern Alignment
- Reuse existing utilities, error handling, and logging conventions surfaced during recon to keep code idiomatic.
- If introducing new abstractions, document the rationale inline or in the handoff summary so reviewers understand the change.

## 4. Immediate Test Work
- As soon as a function compiles, implement or update the mapped tests, fixtures, and mocks described in the input.
- When ambiguity arises, revisit the user input and clarify before deviating from the specified scenarios.
- Keep tests co-located with their targets unless the brief dictates another structure.

## 5. Validation Loop
- Execute the prescribed commands (e.g., `go test ./internal/foo`, `npm run contract-tests`, `make test`) via **Desktop Commander** (`start_process`, `interact_with_process`).
- Capture outputs for each run so logs can be shared during review.
- Rerun targeted suites after every meaningful change to catch regressions early.

## 6. Iteration & Polish
- Iterate until every planned behavior and test passes locally; address flakiness or race conditions uncovered during validation.
- Remove temporary instrumentation, run formatters/linters, and synchronize documentation or comments promised in the brief.
- Record any deviations from the supplied plan along with mitigation steps or follow-up tasks.

## 7. Payload Update & Handoff
- Summarize the final state under `implementation.*` and update relevant `plan`/`testPlan` statuses.
- Provide instructions for reproducing validation (commands, environment variables, MCP calls) so downstream owners can re-run checks confidently.
- Notify the acceptance owner that the payload is ready for Stage 5.
