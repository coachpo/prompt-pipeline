# Troubleshooting

## Request is ambiguous
- Ask targeted questions about scope, affected users, success metrics, and constraints.
- Do not proceed until the requirement is testable.

## Codebase search returns no results
- Record the search terms and paths attempted.
- Add an open question about where the feature should live.

## Existing payload detected
- Create a timestamped backup before changes.
- Confirm whether to append or overwrite requirement content.

## Conflicting constraints
- List the conflicts explicitly in `openQuestions`.
- Propose resolution options and request a decision.
