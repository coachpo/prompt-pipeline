# Troubleshooting

## Prerequisites missing
- Stop and request missing requirement/plan/tasks/testPlan sections.

## Task fails twice
- Mark the task blocked and capture evidence.
- Continue with next ready task.

## Validation command is unsafe
- Request explicit user approval before running.

## Tests are flaky
- Re-run once and record flakiness in evidence.
- Do not mask failures.
