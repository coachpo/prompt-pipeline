# Troubleshooting

## Requirements missing or incomplete
- Stop and request `specifying-requirements` first.

## Triviality gate is unclear
- Document the uncertainty and create a short spike step.
- Mark the plan as provisional until confirmed.

## No prior art found
- Record search paths and terms.
- Add a risk noting unknown patterns or migration impact.

## Too many steps
- Collapse into 3-6 steps and move detail into artifacts.
