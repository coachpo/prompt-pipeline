# Troubleshooting

## Implementation section missing
- Stop and request `implementing-solution` to be rerun.

## Replay failures
- Mark status as rejected and include command evidence.

## Exploratory issues found
- Record steps, expected vs actual, and affected files.
- Reject until fixed.

## Evidence is insufficient
- Re-run commands to capture outputs and timestamps.
- Add missing context before issuing a decision.
