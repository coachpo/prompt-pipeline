# Troubleshooting

## Missing prerequisites
- Stop and request the prior stage outputs.

## Acceptance criteria not covered
- Add scenarios until every criterion is mapped.
- Note any gaps explicitly in the test plan.

## Fixtures missing
- Document required fixtures and add setup commands.
- Mark scenarios blocked until fixtures exist.

## Commands are unknown
- Use existing test scripts or propose placeholders.
- Record as open items to be confirmed.
