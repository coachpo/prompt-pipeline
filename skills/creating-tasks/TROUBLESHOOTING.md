# Troubleshooting

## Plan missing
- Stop and request `creating-plan` first.

## Tasks are too large
- Split tasks until each is 1-2 days and 1-3 files.
- Add acceptance criteria per leaf task.

## File references unknown
- Record the missing references as dependencies.
- Add a discovery task to locate the correct files.

## Dependencies unclear
- Add explicit dependency edges and note assumptions.
